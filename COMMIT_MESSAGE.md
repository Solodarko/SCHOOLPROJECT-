### Bulletproof Data Reconciliation  
- ✅ **ReconciliationService**: Post-meeting API reconciliation using `/past_meetings/{meetingId}/participants`
- ✅ **Smart Participant Matching**: Multiple matching strategies (ID, email, name, time proximity)
- ✅ **Rate Limiting & Queuing**: Built-in protection against Zoom API limits with exponential backoff
- ✅ **UUID Encoding Handling**: Proper double-encoding for Zoom's meeting UUID requirements

### Admin-Ready Reporting System
- ✅ **Enhanced Reports**: Meeting ID | Student Name | Student ID | Email | Time Joined | Status
- ✅ **Multiple Data Sources**: Webhook (real-time) and API (reconciled) data integration
- ✅ **CSV Export**: Download attendance data for external analysis
- ✅ **Live Dashboard Updates**: Real-time attendance monitoring via Socket.IO

### Production-Ready Architecture
- ✅ **Security**: HMAC signature verification, timestamp validation, input sanitization
- ✅ **Performance**: MongoDB indexing, request queuing, caching with TTL
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Health checks, reconciliation stats, queue monitoring
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error tracking, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation

- `POST /api/zoom/reconcile/{meetingId}` - Manual reconciliation trigger

### System Monitoring
- `GET /api/zoom/webhook-status` - Webhook system status
- `GET /api/zoom/webhook-config` - Configuration validation
- `GET /api/zoom/reconciliation-stats` - Reconciliation statistics
- `GET /api/zoom/reconciliation-queue` - Queue monitoring
- `POST /api/zoom/process-reconciliation-queue` - Process queued reconciliations

### Event History
- `GET /api/zoom/webhook-events/{meetingId}` - View webhook event history

## 🔄 Data Flow Implementation

### Real-time Flow
```
Zoom Meeting Event → Webhook Validation (HMAC) → Event Processing → 
Database Storage → Socket.IO Broadcast → Student Matching → 
Reconciliation Queue (if meeting ended)
```

### Reconciliation Flow  
```
Meeting Ends → Queue → Rate-Limited API Call → Data Merge → 
Student Re-matching → Final Status Calculation → Report Generation
```
